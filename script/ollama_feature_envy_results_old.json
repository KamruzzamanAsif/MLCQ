While it has some logic related to encoding, it is not a standalone class that encapsulates these operations. Instead, its primary function is to provide a total length measurement for an object that might have more attributes."

The method `adjustRelativePath` appears to be a utility function that constructs an absolute path from a relative one by appending it to the CATALINA_BASE property of the system properties if necessary. This does not exhibit feature envy (using methods from external classes for logic), large class issues (as there is only one method), or data class characteristics (since there are no instance variables). The method handles edge cases like null or empty strings and throws a FileNotFoundException when the file does not exist."
